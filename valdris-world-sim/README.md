# Valdris World Sim

Minimal extension that injects a small UI panel and logs to the console with a `[VWorldSim]` prefix.

## What it does
- Adds a fixed panel that says "Valdris World Sim loaded".
- Logs `[VWorldSim] Valdris World Sim loaded` in the browser console.

## Notes
- No prompt injection.
- No simulation logic yet.
