### ⚡ Sovereign's Mana Well

**Effect:** Intimidation bonus against enemies. Attraction bonus for those who admire power. Environmental tells (static hair, ozone scent, pressure changes) reveal emotional state.

### 👑 Tempest Soul
**Type:** Core / Passive
**Description:** Lia's soul IS the storm. This isn't metaphor — Vex literally wove tempest essence into her being during the crossing. She doesn't cast storm magic; she IS storm magic given flesh.
